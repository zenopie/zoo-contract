zoo-contract Repository
Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the zoo-contract, which leverages the VRF (Verifiable Random Function) code and has integration with Akash.




VRF Code Documentation
The zoo-contract repository uses the VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for [specific functionality]. Here's an overview and detailed documentation:

Overview
Secret VRF allows the games to access Random numbers to be verifiably fair.

How it Works

Variable Declarations and Value Assignments:

let random_binary = env.block.random.clone(); // secret VRF
This line is cloning a random value from the env.block.random. this value is derived from a "secret VRF", which stands for "Verifiable Random Function". A VRF produces a random value in a way that can be verified by others, ensuring the randomness was not manipulated.

Byte Extraction:

let random_bytes = &random_binary.as_ref().unwrap().0; // as bytes
Here, the code is converting the random_binary value into a byte slice. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

.as_ref(): Converts the Option or Result to a reference. This is useful for manipulating the underlying data without taking ownership.

.unwrap(): This method assumes that the Option or Result contains a value (Some or Ok). If it doesn't (i.e., if it's a None or Err), the program will panic at runtime.

.0: The notation suggests that random_binary.as_ref().unwrap() yields a tuple, and .0 accesses its first element.

Byte Combination:


let random_number = u32::from_le_bytes([
    random_bytes[0],
    random_bytes[1],
    random_bytes[2],
    random_bytes[3],
]);
Here, the code takes the first four bytes of the random_bytes slice and converts them into a single u32 (32-bit unsigned integer) value.

u32::from_le_bytes(): This method reads a byte array of length 4 and interprets it as a u32 value in little-endian order. This means that random_bytes[0] is the least significant byte, and random_bytes[3] is the most significant byte.

Limiting the Range:


let spin = random_number % LENGTH; // set max number for random number
In this step, the random number's range is limited to fit within the range of 0 to LENGTH - 1. This is achieved using the modulo operator (%). For example, if LENGTH is 10, spin will have a value between 0 and 9 inclusive.

To summarize, the code obtains a random byte slice from a verifiable source, extracts the first four bytes, combines them into a single u32 integer, then limits its range to fit between 0 and LENGTH - 1 inclusive.

Akash Integration
This section documents how zoo-contract integrates with Akash.

Why Akash?
Akash is a censorship resistant cloud computing platform with low fees.

Deploying a Containerized Frontend on a Generic Cloud Platform:
1. Prerequisites:
Docker Installed: Ensure you have Docker on your development machine to containerize your frontend.
Cloud Platform Account: Sign up or log in to your Cloudmos account

2. Containerize Your Frontend:
Navigate to your frontend project directory.
Create a Dockerfile that specifies how your frontend should be containerized.
Build your Docker image using the Docker CLI.
Push your Docker image to a container registry.

3. Deploy on Cloudmos:
Log in to your cloud provider's dashboard through a web browser.
Adjust settings like scaling, environment variables, network configuration, etc., as needed.
Start the deployment.
